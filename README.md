# Causal Machine Learning Requires Rigorous Synthetic Experiments for Broader Adoption

This repository contains the code to reproduce experiments from our paper "Causal Machine Learning Requires Rigorous Synthetic Experiments for Broader Adoption".

## Overview

This repository explores some key issues in causal machine learning evaluation:

1. Examining bias in semi-synthetic datasets (Problem 2 in the paper)
2. Testing the limits beyond the identification domain (Problem 3 in the paper)

## Repository Structure

- `causal-flows/`: Code and experiments for CausalNF
- `realcause/`: Code and experiments for RealCause

Detailed setup instructions for each experiment are available in:

- `causal-flows/setup.md`: Setup and execution instructions for CausalNF experiments
- `realcause/setup.md`: Setup and execution instructions for RealCause experiments
